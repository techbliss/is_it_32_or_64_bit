32 or 64 bit Sigcheck quickmenu.

I made this windows quick menu for Sigcheck, since i had to troubleshoot a file that was not the right arch in a software, and dependency walker didn't helped out.

It scan both file and folders.

Sigcheck by sysinternals is a command line tool, so i added it to the right click menu to speed it up a little.



**install**

Download [Sigcheck](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897441.aspx)

create a folder named Sigcheck in C:\Program Files (x86)\

so it is exactly C:\Program Files (x86)\Sigcheck\sigcheck.exe

Add gear.ico to Sigcheck folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Sigcheck\gear.ico

Double click sigcheck_menu.reg to add the menu to right click menu.

**Single file**
